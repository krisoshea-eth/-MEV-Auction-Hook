# MEV-Auction-Hook
Uses an Eigenlayer AVS to run an auction to determine which arbitrageur gets their transaction included first in a block. The auction proceeds are then shared amongst LPs in the pool the hook was triggered on. The goal of this hook is to 1) enable the use of an Eigenlayer AVS to run the auction and 2) reduce loss versus rebalancing.
