Original Swapper's Perspective
Initiating a Swap:

The original swapper calls the swap function on the Uniswap V4 contract.
This triggers the beforeSwap hook in the MevAuctionHook contract.
beforeSwap Hook:

The beforeSwap function creates a new auction using createNewTask in the IncredibleSquaringTaskManager.
Swap details, such as the original sender and the amount specified, are stored in the swaps mapping.
The auction is set to last for 10 minutes, during which arbitrageurs can bid to perform the swap.
The swap is paused, waiting for the auction to complete and for the highest bidder (arbitrageur) to perform the swap.
Arbitrageur's Perspective
Bidding in the Auction:

Arbitrageurs monitor new auctions and submit their bids using the submitBid function.
Each bid must be higher than the current highest bid to be considered.
The highest bid and bidder are updated in the auctions mapping.
Winning the Auction:

Once the auction ends, the highest bidder is recorded.
The winning arbitrageur calls the executeSwap function to perform the swap.
executeSwap Function Logic
Verification:

The executeSwap function verifies that the caller is the highest bidder of the auction and that the bid amount matches the highest bid.
The arbitrageur must send the bid amount (msg.value) with the transaction.
Marking Swap as Completed:

The swap details are marked as completed in the swaps mapping to ensure it cannot be executed again.
Performing the Swap:

The arbitrageur performs the swap by calling the swap function on the Uniswap V4 pool manager.
The swap executes normally, but the output of the swap is sent to the original swapper.
The arbitrageur effectively performs the swap on behalf of the original swapper.
Sending Swap Output to Original Swapper:

The bid amount sent by the arbitrageur is held by the contract to be distributed later.
afterSwap Hook
Verification:

The afterSwap hook verifies that the swap was completed by checking the isCompleted flag in the swaps mapping.
Distributing Bid Amount to Liquidity Providers:

The bid amount (msg.value) held by the contract is distributed to the liquidity providers in the pool.
This happens within the distributeToLPs function.
